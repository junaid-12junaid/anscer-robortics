# Notes

## Improving Robot State Management Experience

- **Real-Time State Updates**: Implement WebSocket or similar technologies to provide real-time updates on state changes.
- **State History and Auditing**: Maintain a history of state changes for auditing and debugging purposes.
- **State Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation to ensure the integrity of state data.
- **Error Handling**: Establish robust error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and notify of any issues.

## Streaming Data/Logs from Robot

- Utilize WebSocket or similar protocols to stream data and logs in real-time from the robot to the application.

## Communicating Errors

- Implement an alerting system that notifies users of critical errors and issues via email, SMS, or in-app notifications.

## Additional State Properties

- **lastTransitionedAt**: Timestamp for the last state transition.
- **priority**: Priority level of the state to help with task scheduling and resource allocation.

## General Thoughts

- The system should be scalable to handle numerous state changes efficiently.
- Implementing caching mechanisms could significantly improve performance.
